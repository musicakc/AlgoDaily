/*
Max Rectangle in a Histogram
We're given a histogram like the following, where contiguous (sharing a common border or touching) bars are made up of different heights. Let's assume all bars have the same width.

The histogram is converted to an array of the heights of the bars:

const histArr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1]

With this knowledge, can we find the largest rectangular area within the histogram?
