/*
Let's build a very basic calculator by programming it. Can you write a function that will evaluate a simple expression string without using your language's eval method?

const expr = "2 + 2";

calculator(expr)

// 4

It should also be able to handle positive and negative symbols +,-, parentheses (), and spaces.

let expr = "3 - 1 + 2";

calculator(expr)

// 4



expr = "(2+(4+2)-1)-(5+8)"

calculator(expr)

// -6

Assume for now that you don't need to handle multiplication or division cases.
